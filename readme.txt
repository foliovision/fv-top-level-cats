This is a fix of Top Level Categories plugin for Wordpress 3.1. and above.

== Description ==

This is a fix of Top Level Category plugin for Wordpress 3.1. and further versions. It's purpose is to provide the same behavior as the original plugin, but in new Wordpress versions.

The Top Level Categories plugin allows you to remove the prefix before the URL to your category page. For example, instead of http://foliovision.com/category/work, you can use http://foliovision.com/work for the address of "work" category. WordPress doesn't allow you to have a blank prefix for categories (they insert `category/` before the name), this plugin works around that restriction.

This plugin works also if you have a permalink structure like %postname% or %category%/%postname% -- this wasn't possible in the original version. However, this feature might not work properly for child categories at this point. Test carefully!

== Installation ==

1. Copy the `top-level-cats.php` file into your `wp-content/plugins` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. That's it! :)

== Known Issues / Bugs ==

1. Issue with paging and feed URLs when using `%postname` or `%category%/%postname%` permalink structure should be fixed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I automatically redirect people from the old category permalink? =

We recommend that you use the [Redirection](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/redirection/) plugin and add your old an new category links, or use a Regex redirection rule. Make sure you change Tools -> Redirection -> Options -> URL Monitoring to "Don't monitor", as there is a [bug](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-redirection-my-homepage-is-being-redirected-to-a-page-need-some-help) in that feature (also in latest current version 2.2.5) - not related to FV Top Level Categories.

= I'm having issues with child categories when I'm using /%category%/%postname% permalink structure =

Make sure your categories have unique slugs - watch out for pages with the same slugs. Normally Wordpress uses the category prefix to distinguish page from a category, but with this plugin you need to make sure the slugs are unique, otherwise some pages might turn up instead of categories.

== Uninstall ==

1. Deactivate the plugin
1. That's it! :)

* Category restrictions for post permalinks added! If you use post permalink structure with category in it, you can now restrict which categories will be allowed in the URL. Wordpress always picks the category with lowest category ID and that often causes inappropriate categories to show up in URLs - like /featured-content/2014/07/my-post"
* Or you can simply force only the parent categories to show up in post URLs. So /parent-category/child-category/2014/07/my-post will change to /parent-category/2014/07/my-post
* If you open the old post URL, proper 301 redirection to the new URL will be used.
